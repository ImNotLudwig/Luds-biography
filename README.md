This is my first time on Git... I am confusion

ahh yes, download the entire folder, then click on the web icon that says "index.html"

if (ForSomeReasonTheCssDoesNotWantToLoad error) //occurs...
{
   You might have to click on every single picture in order to get it to load or smth
}

honestly I suck at html when it comes to filing
